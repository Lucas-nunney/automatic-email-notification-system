# Email System

The **Email System** lets you send emails at a set time using your Gmail account. You can schedule emails to friends, reminders, or notifications automatically.  

**How it works:**  
1. Enter the recipient, subject, and message.  
2. Choose the date and time to send.  
3. The system sends it using your Gmail account securely.  

> **Note:** To use this system with Gmail, you will need to generate an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) if you have 2-Step Verification enabled, or follow Gmailâ€™s OAuth flow for secure access. update the .env file with the neccesary info afterwards
